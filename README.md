# OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander V2
 
The folder named 'old' is based on this implementation (https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_oVl47ZKSTh2gJIK73YX9BQ/) but rewritten to my needs.
The train.ipynb is to train the machine learning models, afterwards you can run the test.ipynb to test it.

The folder named 'new' is build from the ground up based on the steps provided by the teacher.
